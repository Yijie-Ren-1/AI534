There are 3 python files -- IA2_part_1.py, IA2_part_2.py and train_final.py, which corresponds to 3 parts in IA2 assignment. Both part 1 and part 2 python files will output the top 5 features and the corresponding lambda to the console, which is the answer for 1(b) and 2(b). I've attached all the required figures to the report, and the figure required in 1(c) and 2(c) will also be stored in a folder named "plots" after running both IA2_part_1.py and IA2_part_2.py.

If you want to check the results for Kaggle, please run train_final.py. The results will be the final submission file to Kaggle, which will be stored in the same directory as the code in.

1. Please activate python3 virtual environment in the same directory where the python file and the data are. Please make sure the data files and python files are under same folder.
2. Please install these python3 packages under the virtual environment: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 
3. To run the program, please use the following command: python3 IA2_part_1.py, python3 IA2_part_2.py, python3 train_final.py, for different parts.

I've tested on the babylon server. Though it threw out some warnings for IA2_part_1.py, (which does not appear on my local environment...), the python files should work~^_^
