There are 3 python files -- IA3_part_1.py, IA3_part_2a.py and IA3_part_2b.py, which refers to Part 1, Part 2a, Part 2b, respectively. The results of all 3 python files are figures, and the console output is the iteration number and value of p, if applicable. I've attached all the required figures to the report, and all figures (including runtime figures) will also be stored in a folder named "plots" after running different python files.

If you want to check the figures for runtime, please comment the code followed by "# draw accuracy plot for train & val", and uncomment the code followed by "# draw runtime plot for different training size".

1. Please activate python3 virtual environment in the same directory where the python file and the data are. Please make sure the data files and python files are under same folder.
2. Please install these python3 packages under the virtual environment: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 
3. To run the program, please use the following command: python3 IA3_part_1.py, python3 IA3_part_2a.py, python3 IA3_part_2b.py, for different parts.

I've tested on the babylon server, the python files should work~^_^
