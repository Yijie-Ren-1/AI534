There is only one python file, which contains the results for each question in Part II. Please see the comments in the python file to run the code for different questions. I also commented every "print()" function for each question. If you want to check the results, please uncomment the "print()" function and rerun the code. All the figures will save at the same folder where you put the python file.

1. Please activate python3 virtual environment in the same directory where the python file and the data are. The data file name is pa0(train-only).csv, same as its downloaded name. Please make sure the data file and python file are under same folder.
2. Please install these python3 packages under the virtual environment: pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. 
3. To run the program, please use the following command: python3 IA0.py

I've tested on the babylon server, so the python file should work~^_^
